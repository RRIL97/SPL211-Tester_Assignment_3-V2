---------


This is a multi threaded client that was written in java in order to replace the c++ version of the client.
This allows you to code your own multi threaded tests without relying on the actual c++ client you have written. (Since c++ ver is single threaded)
This is only meant to test the server part. (Syncing or w/e)

There are code examples under GeneralTests.java
